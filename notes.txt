For clustering genes together, use k-means rather than hierarchical
clustering.
Use decision tree classifier.
When we do PCA, color samples by disease state, and by classification using
trees or k-means.
We can also do a correlation study between age and genes.
There is also a 3rd party hierarchical clustering toolbox available.
