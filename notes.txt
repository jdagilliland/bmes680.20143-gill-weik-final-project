For clustering genes together, use k-means rather than hierarchical
clustering.
Use decision tree classifier.
When we do PCA, color samples by disease state, and by classification using
trees or k-means.
We can also do a correlation study between age and genes.
There is also a 3rd party hierarchical clustering toolbox available.

At this point (2015-06-04), we have:
* a working classification tree that may furnish interesting biomarkers
* correlation p-values and coefficients for features with age and disease
* k-means clustering which seems to closely correlate with disease

TODO:
* age colored PCA scatter plot
* quantify how well k-means clustering correlates with disease
* look at the differences between lists of genes that correlate with age in
  alzheimers vs. those which do so in normals
* perhaps look into hierarchical clustering of samples
